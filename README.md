# Repressilator
Plot repressilator variables while changing all the parameters.

Here's the repressilator program which plots the variables involved.
It takes a while to plot (depending on the step size), so try being patient.

Download the .exe binary from [release](https://github.com/blurrycontour/Repressilator/releases/download/v1.0/Repressilator.exe).

Enjoy :)
